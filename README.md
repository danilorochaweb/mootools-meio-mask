Notice
------

Versions 1.x will support MooTools 1.2.x while 2.x will support 1.3.x.
If you are using version 1.x, you'll need version 1.2.4 or greater of mootools-core because the plugin uses Browser.Engine.gecko engine detection, which just work on those versions.

Building
--------

Just run `make` and a Build folder will be created cointaining the complete library for debugging/development and the minified file for
use in production.

You can create your own customized build by editing the modules included in the built file in the build.py script.

Dependencies
------------

The only dependency is Element.Forms, which you can grab at http://mootools.net/more/.

Run the Tests
-------------

You can easily run the tests on your default browser by using `make run`.
